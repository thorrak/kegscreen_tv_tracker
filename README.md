# KegScreen TV

Watch your kegs on your TV!

KegScreen TV brings your KegScreen Digital Taplist or Keg Cop Keg Monitor to your TV. See your digital tap list and monitor your kegs without having to hook an HDMI cable up to a computer!

KegScreen TV automatically scans your local network to detect KegScreen installations and Keg Cop devices and lets you select the tap list you want to display from the devices found. If KegScreen can't find the device (or you want to use a device on another network) simply enter the device's URL and KegScreen TV will do the rest.

KegScreen TV is specifically designed for KegScreen and Keg Cop and will not work with other digital taplist solutions.
